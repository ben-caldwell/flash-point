# Flash Point
The board game Flash Point in Python

some info to get started:

-comments on existing code are coming soon

-right now there is an issue with the movement (feel free to have a look and see what you think)

-to run this on the python IDLE though you will need to install the pygame module (download here if you need it http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame )
